To add your own romantic pictures to the gallery:

1.  **Gather your photos**:
    -   Find the best photos of you and your Valentine.
    -   Rename them to something simple like `pic1.jpg`, `pic2.jpg`, `pic3.jpg`, etc. (Supported formats: .jpg, .png, .jpeg, .webp).

2.  **Add them to the project**:
    -   Drag and drop your photo files into the `public` folder of this project (the same place where `song.mp3` is).

3.  **Update the code**:
    -   Open the file: `src/components/SuccessGallery.tsx`
    -   Look for the `memories` list at the top of the file (around line 7).
    -   Change the `url` for each memory to match your file names.
    -   Update the `message` to be your own personal caption!

**Example:**

```typescript
const memories = [
    {
        id: 1,
        url: "/pic1.jpg",  // <-- Your first picture filename (must include the leading /)
        message: "Our first date at the coffee shop ☕" // <-- Your caption
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        url: "/pic2.jpg",
        message: "The day you said yes! 💍"
    },
    // ... add as many as you want!
];
```

**Tips:**
-   Landscape (horizontal) photos work best for the slideshow.
-   Make sure the filename in the code matches the actual filename exactly (case-sensitive!).
